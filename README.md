# Daily Planner Project

The goal of this project is to build a Daily Efficiency Scheduler, which allows users to input their daily tasks and generates an optimized schedule based on priority or randomization. The scheduler should provide an intuitive interface for users to input tasks, specify available hours, and receive an organized schedule that can be downloaded as a text file.

Key Features:

User Task Input:

Users can input multiple tasks.
Option to stop task entry by typing "done."
Time Management:

Users can specify available hours for scheduling.
The system should allocate time efficiently based on priority or randomization.
Tasks will be displayed in the format 9:30 AM - 10:30 AM for clarity.
Randomized Scheduling Option:

If enabled, the system will randomly assign task durations and order.
Downloadable Output:

Generated schedules will be saved in a downloadable text file format.
Technical Requirements:

Python programming language
Libraries: datetime, random
Text file handling for exporting schedules
Benefits:

Helps users organize their daily activities efficiently.
Enhances time management skills.
Provides a simple and effective way to visualize daily plans.
Expected Outcome:
A functional application that generates and exports personalized daily schedules based on user input, improving productivity and planning efficiency.
