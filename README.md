# Daily Planner Project

The goal of this project is to build a Daily Efficiency Scheduler, which allows users to input their daily tasks and generates an optimized schedule based on priority or randomization. The scheduler should provide an intuitive interface for users to input tasks, specify available hours, and receive an organized schedule that can be downloaded as a text file.
